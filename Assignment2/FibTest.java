Fibonacci revisited (10 points)

Create a file called FibTest.java. Refactor your Fib.java from assignment 1 to be a static method in
FibTest. Odds are that your assignment 1 answer is coded in iterative style, where you are looping
from 1 to n and adding up numbers as you go. If not, you should write an iterative Fibonacci
calculator that does so (and refactor the version that you wrote for assignment 1 for the next part
of the problem). This method should be called

public static int fibIter(int n)

The recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence is the following:
	f ib(1) = 1
	f ib(2) = 1
	f ib(n) = f ib(n − 1) + f ib(n − 2)
	Write another static method in the same FibTest class, this time in recursive style, using this
relationship.

public static int fibRecur(int n)

In FibTest’s main method, write a series of tests that establishes that both of these functions work
correctly. Finally, using Java’s System.currentTimeMillis() function, print out the time it takes
to execute FibTest.fibIter(40) and FibTest.fibRecur(40).
