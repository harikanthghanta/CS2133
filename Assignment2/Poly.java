Polynomials (30 points)
Write a class Poly.java to represent polynomials (ie, functions of the form ax n + bx n−1 + · · · + cx 2 + dx + e). Implement the following methods:

• Poly(int[] coefficients): Constructor for an array of coefficients where c[n] is the coefficient of
x n . In other words, the polynomial 2x 5 + 3x 4 − 8x 2 + 4 would be represented by the array [4, 0, −8, 0, 3, 2]. This way, if I want to know the coefficient of x 2 , I look at c[2], and get −8. This convenience is worth the confusion that arises because we usually write arrays left-to-right starting from the smallest index, whereas we usually write polynomials left-to-right starting from the largest coefficient.

• int degree(): Return the power of the highest non-zero term

• String toString(): Overriding the Object class’s toString method, this should return a String representation of the polynomial using x as the variable, arranged in decreasing order of exponent and printing nothing for terms with a coefficient of zero. For example, the Poly represented by the array [4, 0, −8, 0, 3, 2] should return the string:

2x^5+3x^4-8x^2+4

• Poly add(Poly a): To add two polynomials, simply add together each scale degree in turn. Thus, (2x 5 + 3x 4 − 8x 2 + 4) + (x 3 + 4x 2 − 2x) = (2x 5 + 3x 4 + x 3 − 4x 2 − 2x + 4). Create a method that constructs and returns a new Poly object with a new coefficient array created by adding the coefficients of the current object and the Poly object a passed as an argument to the add() function.

• double evaluate(double x): Return the value of the function at the point x. In other words, if the Poly object represents 2x 5 + 3x 4 − 8x 2 + 4 and evaluate(2.0) is called, the method should calculate 2(2) 5 + 3(2) 4 − 8(2) 2 + 4 and return 84.

Within the main() method of the Poly class, create a series of tests which exercise each of these methods and report their success or failure.
